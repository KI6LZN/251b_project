# Investigation of Adaptive Filtering Techniques for Vehicle Tracking in Videos
This is code for the ECE 251B Project in the Spring 2021 quarter.

This project focuses on adaptive filtering algorithms used for tracking individual vehicles as they move through a surveillance-style traffic video.

# Data
The dataset being used for this project is the University at Albany DEtection and TRACking (UA-DETRAC) image set. This is available through their website at: https://detrac-db.rit.albany.edu/ and https://sites.google.com/view/daweidu/projects/ua-detrac.
